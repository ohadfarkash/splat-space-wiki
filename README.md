# Splat Space Wiki

## What is this?

Splat Space used to have a media wiki style wiki. The plan here is to dramatically lower the barrier to entry. There's an overwhelming number of software engineers in Splat Space these days, and git is a familiar tool. The hope is that people will feel more inclined to submit revisions to simple markdown files.

Consider this a repository of important information related various pieces of equipment in Splat Space. If you service a piece of equipment, and want to keep track of that, make a change to its mardown file. If you want to leave helpfull tips, or resources, or configuration files, this is the place to do it.

If this experiment works, it may migrate into a new wiki, but for now this should do just fine.
